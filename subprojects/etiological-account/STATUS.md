# Etiological Account - Status

**Current state:** Draft complete, 26 pages, clean build

## 2026-01-29 Session Notes

- Unified entry/exit under two-module architecture (§3.5 rewritten)
  - Supply is positive-evidence channel, not third module
  - Invasion is coordination game flipping basins
  - Drift is noise term in sampling-and-feedback dynamics
- Addressed six paper-level vulnerabilities:
  1. Disambiguated "doubly sustained" (etiological 2×2 vs constitutive compounding)
  2. Fixed LBE processing rationale (determiner-noun separation)
  3. Added register diagnostic (τ(c) shift vs C_t shift)
  4. Added concrete w_i operationalization pipeline sketch
  5. Anchored niche gap mass as heuristic, not metric
  6. Softened "moralistic punishment" → "distributed enforcement"
- House style fixes: "must" → "have to", wh- → interrogative, semantic macros
- Fixed premature term/symbol introductions:
  - "doubly/singly sustained" → "gaps sustained by both/one module(s)" before §5
  - "niche $n$" and "posteriors" in §2.2 → plain language (frameworks introduced later)
  - "coordination games" in Module 2 intro → removed, added forward reference
- Fixed duplicate bib entries (kirby2014, labov1972, nowak2006, Sperber1996→sperber1996)
- Added TikZ DAG (Figure 1) showing two-module architecture in §5
- Updated asterisk paper's forward reference to accurately describe both modules

## 2026-01-28 Session Notes

- Made paper self-contained (no longer assumes reader has asterisk paper in hand)
- Implemented Powell/Blythe feedback on high-leverage fixes
- House style enforced throughout
- **Key pending revision:** Section 3.5 "The arise side" treats entry/innovation as extra machinery outside the two modules. Session ended with insight that entry can be folded INTO the modules:
  - Module 1 (Bayesian): same Beta-posterior works bidirectionally; asymmetry is in evidence availability (absence is cheap, presence requires supply)
  - Module 2 (coordination): same equilibrium logic works bidirectionally; entry = equilibrium shift via stochastic stability mechanisms
  - This is cleaner architecture: two modules handle both directions, asymmetry is emergent

## Next steps

1. ~~Revise Section 3.5 to unify entry/exit under the two modules~~ ✓
2. Final read-through for coherence
3. ~~Build and check references (biber warns of duplicate keys)~~ ✓
