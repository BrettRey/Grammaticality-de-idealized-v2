# Etiological Account - Status

**Current state:** Draft complete, 24 pages, pending architectural revision

## 2026-01-28 Session Notes

- Made paper self-contained (no longer assumes reader has asterisk paper in hand)
- Implemented Powell/Blythe feedback on high-leverage fixes
- House style enforced throughout
- **Key pending revision:** Section 3.5 "The arise side" treats entry/innovation as extra machinery outside the two modules. Session ended with insight that entry can be folded INTO the modules:
  - Module 1 (Bayesian): same Beta-posterior works bidirectionally; asymmetry is in evidence availability (absence is cheap, presence requires supply)
  - Module 2 (coordination): same equilibrium logic works bidirectionally; entry = equilibrium shift via stochastic stability mechanisms
  - This is cleaner architecture: two modules handle both directions, asymmetry is emergent

## Next steps

1. Revise Section 3.5 to unify entry/exit under the two modules
2. Final read-through for coherence
3. Build and check references
