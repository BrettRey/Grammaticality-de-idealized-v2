I will start by listing the files in the directory to confirm the target PDF files and filter out the duplicates. Then, I will search these files for keywords related to your requested topics (contingency, convergence, replay, norms, constraints) to locate the relevant passages for extraction.

I will list the files again, strictly observing the `ignore` parameter as an array to filter out the duplicates.
I will search the specified PDF files for terms related to "contingency," "convergence," and "replay" to identify the most relevant sections for extraction.
I will read the first 100 lines of `9780262356596_caa.pdf` and `9780262356596_cab.pdf` to determine their content and confirm if the text is accessible.
I will read the next batch of PDF files: `caf`, `cak`, `cao`, and `cas` to extract relevant text.
