# CLAUDE.md - The Operator Stratum

**Parent project:** `Grammaticality_de_idealized/` (MVMG)
**Status:** Complete draft

## Overview

This paper argues that grammaticality judgments target a specific kind of value: **operator value**. It defines what operators ARE and why they're special - they function as public coordination infrastructure.

## Build

```bash
xelatex main.tex && biber main && xelatex main.tex
```

Uses EB Garamond font. Bibliography is self-contained in `refs.bib`.

## Inheritance

This subproject inherits:
- House style from `../../.house-style/` (via parent)
- Editorial conventions from parent `CLAUDE.md`

## Connection to Parent

- MVMG's `C_t` (licensing) = entrenchment in the operator stratum
- MVMG's `map` (structural viability) = whether something can be an operator
- MVMG's `K` (interpretive coherence) = whether operator values cohere

This paper explains WHY some form-value relations get policed as grammar.
