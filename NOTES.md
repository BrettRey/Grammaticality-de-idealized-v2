### Jong-Bok Kim (Dec 2025) - On licensing vs gradience

Kim (SBCG/HPSG theorist, Kyung Hee University) responded to questions about formal grammar and grammaticality:

> "The licensing-based theory, to my knowledge, has no clear distinction between well-formed ones and those with ? or ??, thus not clear about gradience. The grammar would accept all such, while not licensing * sentences. As for the grammaticalization, this would then imply that the grammar would license all the diachronic developments."

**Relevance to MVMG:** This is exactly the gap your model addresses:
- Discrete licensing captures * vs. not-*, but nothing in between
- The MVMG's F(u) function models gradient acceptability
- Kim's admission from within the formal tradition supports the claim that formal grammars need something like MVMG to capture judgment patterns

### Related: Transparent Free Relatives (`Transparent_free_relatives/`)

Kim proposed collaboration on TFRs (Dec 27). TFRs may show **gradient acceptability** based on internal/external feature match:
- Perfect match → fully acceptable
- Partial match → marginal
- Mismatch → degraded

This could be empirical evidence for the MVMG-style gradient grammaticality model -- TFRs as a test case for F(u) predictions.
