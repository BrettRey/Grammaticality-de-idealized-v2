## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Rachell Powell Connection ⚠️

**Status:** NOT STARTED (Jan 26, 2026)

Rachell Powell (BU Philosophy) - *Contingency and Convergence* (MIT Press 2020)

**Why this matters:**
- Powell's contingency/convergence framework maps onto the OVMG project
- Operators as *convergent* solutions to coordination problems (like eyes, wings)
- Morphosyntactic realization as *contingent* (language-specific implementation)
- Her "deep vs shallow replay" distinction: grammatical categories contingent at origin but convergent given cognitive/social constraints

**Questions Powell would ask:**
1. What *mechanism* drives convergence toward closed-paradigm operators?
2. Does OVMG tell us about evolution of linguistic cognition, not just structure?

**Sub-project connections:** Grammar_and_emergence, Labels_to_Stabilisers, TFRs

## Powell: Bottom-Up Norm Enforcement in Social Insects

**Added:** 2026-01-27
**Source:** Rachell Powell (BU), *Contingency and Convergence* (MIT 2020)

Powell observes that social insects enforce norms bottom-up, not via central authority. Every local policing interaction aggregates into colony-level norms.

**Connection to OVMG:** This is structurally identical to C_t. Community licensing isn't a decree; it emerges from distributed speakers reacting to each other's usage. Even what looks like a "structural crash" (*Can the have running*) is ultimately a region where bottom-up convergence is so total it appears categorical.

**Implications:**
1. C_t isn't a sociological add-on — bottom-up norm enforcement is widespread in biology
2. Counters the "grammar police" caricature: enforcement is distributed, not top-down
3. Strengthens the convergence story for operators (convergent solutions maintained by distributed mechanisms)

**Assessment for asterisk paper:** Does NOT belong there. The paper is tight and self-contained; adding biological analogies opens doors it can't close. JoL readers would ask "how far does the insect analogy extend?" and there's no space to answer. The formal model already implies bottom-up enforcement — C_t is community licensing, not authority licensing.

**Where it belongs:**
- **HPC book** (best fit): HPC kinds maintained by distributed mechanisms, not top-down definitions. Chapter-level point.
- **Parent OVMG paper**: More room for foundational framing of C_t's nature.
- **Grammar_and_emergence** (Nefdt): Bottom-up emergence of grammatical norms. (But NO LLMs on that project.)

## ⚠️ PRIORITY: Integrate Operator Stratum Paper ⚠️

**Status:** NOT STARTED (Jan 25, 2026)
**Source:** `subprojects/operator-stratum/Reynolds_Operator_Stratum.pdf` (uploaded to lingbuzz)

The CxG section (~line 1144 in main.tex) claims morphosyntax is "uniquely privileged" but doesn't explain WHY. The operator stratum paper provides the answer.

### What to add:

1. **refs.bib**: Add Reynolds 2026 citation for operator stratum paper

2. **main.tex CxG section**: Explain WHY morphosyntax is special:
   - Morphosyntactic form-value relations serve as **operators**
   - Operators = closed-paradigm contrasts that configure public update, allocate participant roles, constrain uptake
   - Information-theoretic: operators are header-like (few bits, large downstream entropy reduction)

3. **Consider adding** the three-stratum distinction:
   - Expression-shape ("not a word")
   - Operator ("can't say that")
   - Payload (negotiation)

### Key quote from stratum paper:
> Operators configure how utterances update shared commitments, allocate participant roles, and constrain uptake.

**Delete this section once integration is complete.**

## External Feedback

### Jong-Bok Kim (Dec 2025) - On licensing vs gradience

Kim (SBCG/HPSG theorist, Kyung Hee University) responded to questions about formal grammar and grammaticality:

> "The licensing-based theory, to my knowledge, has no clear distinction between well-formed ones and those with ? or ??, thus not clear about gradience. The grammar would accept all such, while not licensing * sentences. As for the grammaticalization, this would then imply that the grammar would license all the diachronic developments."

**Relevance to MVMG:** This is exactly the gap your model addresses:
- Discrete licensing captures * vs. not-*, but nothing in between
- The MVMG's F(u) function models gradient acceptability
- Kim's admission from within the formal tradition supports the claim that formal grammars need something like MVMG to capture judgment patterns

**Full correspondence:** See `HPC book/correspondence/kim-jongbok-2025-12.md`

### Related: Transparent Free Relatives (`Transparent_free_relatives/`)

Kim proposed collaboration on TFRs (Dec 27). TFRs may show **gradient acceptability** based on internal/external feature match:
- Perfect match → fully acceptable
- Partial match → marginal
- Mismatch → degraded

This could be empirical evidence for the MVMG-style gradient grammaticality model -- TFRs as a test case for F(u) predictions.
